I've had classes that lasted 30 minutes, and I've had one class that lasted 3h 40m. One class switched from PHP/MySQL into a 30 minute explanation of how the internet (and web servers in particular) work, just because the student was a little unclear. You set the pace, except that I'll refuse to continue ahead until I'm sure you're comfortable with what we've already spoken about.\n\nEven if you know nothing about computers beyond how to install Skype and sign in, I will teach you. I have a couple of students as young as 14, and one student who can't do voice chat because of hearing difficulties. I will put up with a lot of crap to teach you, as long as I think you want to learn. :D\n\nPlease keep in mind that while I can teach you how to convert something in your imagination into a webpage or an image, I cannot imagine things for you. In these classes, I will cover some principles of good design, and I will provide you with the knowledge to convert a concept into reality, but **creating a good design is still your job.**\n\nInstructions for \"signing up\" are in that post linked on the top.

I am trying to gather some material together, some of it was deleted for unknown reason when I went to sleep, but in any case if no-one experienced is going to show up it will take a long while to put a course together due to the amount of information that needs to be analyzed. The links are here, so if you want to deepen your understanding right now, it is up to you. I believe the steps to be taken when putting a course are:  \n1)Gather all the information available  \n2)Sort and filter to find the best sources  \n3)Pick from the sources, the concepts that are the core of the course and find a nice layout to gradually introduce those.  \nEDIT2:I got a response from the author of the comment that was deleted (with all the great links) and it was something unrelated", "likes": null, "saved": false, "id": "ozt4y", "clicked": false, "title": "[Request] Introduction to Critical thinking or Philosophy of Science", "media": null, "score": 21, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rqj9", "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 5, "is_self": true, "permalink": "/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/ozt4y/request_introduction_to_critical_thinking_or/", "name": "t3_ozt4y", "created": 1327706750.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/ozt4y/request_introduction_to_critical_thinking_or/", "author_flair_text": null, "author": "Skynet2009", "created_utc": 1327706750.0, "num_comments": 10, "ups": 26}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.UniversityofReddit", "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "UniversityofReddit", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lesson 3 of 5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We start to get into real drills at this point.
